In Hubs and Spoke, visitors can create their own avatars and scenes. They can then offer to share that content with others, which will let visitors discover the content through tools like the Media Browser.

However, as the administrator of a hub, you don't always want the content contributed by visitors to be surfaced. For example, it may contain inappropriate or illegal content. Hubs Cloud comes with a set of content moderation tools, so you can fully control and filter the content submitted by your visitors.

### Content Pipeline

When a visitor creates a custom avatar or scene, they are offered the option to mark it as *remixable* and/or *promotable*. *Remixable* content confers a Creative Commons 3 license to the content so others are free to use or modify it, and *promotable* content will be enqueued for review to be added to your hub's content library. Once it is approved, content in the library can be discovered by users through tools like the Media Browser.

All content marked as *Promotable* will be added to the **Pending Scene/Avatar Queue** when it is either created or updated. You can find these queues in your [Admin Console](./hubs-cloud-getting-started.md):
