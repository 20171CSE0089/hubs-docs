## There is echo in the room

Echo is often caused by a participant not wearing headphones. You can ask the room to mute their mic, or as a room moderator you can mute them yourself in their avatar menu. 

You may also click the "-" button above their head while in freeze mode to lower their volume all the way to 0, but this will only reduce their volume on your client will mean that you can't hear them at all anymore.

## Images aren't displaying properly

Sometimes older systems have trouble rendering 2D objects in the scene. If you suspect this is happening, try reloading the page with the ?disablebatching flag at the end of the URL. 

e.g. hubs.mozilla.com/sgKNM3h/smart-magnificent-gala?disablebatching

## Getting stuck on loading screen 

Sometimes rooms have many complex objects in them can be slow to load on older and mobile devices. If you are getting stuck on the loading screen, try refreshing the page or entering the scene on another device. 

## My wired-in headset's not working

If wired-in headset's isn't connecting, it may be a good idea to check the following: 

* Does your browser support WebVR? To test, visit https://webvr.info/samples/XX-vr-controllers.html 
* Is Steam VR / Oculus App and browser up to date?
* Is your browser using the same graphics card as the VR Headset?
