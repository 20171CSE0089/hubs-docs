## What is the capacity of a Hubs Room

We recommend a maximum of 25 in-room participants. This capacity is the default because low power devices, such as mobile phones and standalone VR headsets, may begin experiencing performance issues in busier rooms. You can adjust the room capacity in the [room settings](hubs-room-settings) menu. 

Once a room is full, all additional users (participant #26 and beyond) can still participate by watching from the lobby. Users in the lobby can see what's happening in the room and interact via text chat; however, they are not represented as avatars in the room and their mic is not active. 

If you want to scale Hubs for a larger event we recommend splitting crowds into multiple rooms with smaller groups, or live streaming the event, depending on the use case. 

For more information on setting up Hubs for large events, contact hubs@mozilla.com.

## Can I share a powerpoint presentation in Hubs?

Hubs is great for giving presentations. Supported media types are pdf files, images, 3D models, audio, video, webcam input, and screen sharing. 

To use a powerpoint in Hubs, you can convert it to a .pdf file and import it directly into Hubs, or you can use screen sharing to stream a view of your presentation into Hubs. 


## What devices does hubs run on?

Because it runs in the browser, Hubs is very cross-platform compatible. It works on mobile, desktop, and VR devices, and runs on most modern browsers. For more information check out the [supported devices" & browsers](./hubs-create-join-rooms.html#supported-devices--browsers) section. 

## Can I create custom environments?

Environments are completely customizable using [Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke), Hubs' web-based scene editing tool, [learn more here](intro-spoke.html). 

## How do I record my event in Hubs

We recommend using screen recording software like OBS to capture events in Hubs. 

To hide the user interface when recording, you can press the tilde key (~), or turn on [camera mode](hubs-room-settings.html#camera-mode).

## Why is there echo in the room?

Check out the [troubleshooting](hubs-troubleshooting.html#there-is-echo-in-the-room) section.

## How much does Hubs cost for an event

Creating private rooms on [hubs.mozilla.com](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke) is free!

If you are interested in hosting an event, or would like to create  a customized Hubs environment on your own infrastructure/domain, please reach out to hubs@mozilla.com for information and pricing.
