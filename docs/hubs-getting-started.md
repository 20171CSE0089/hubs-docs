* introduce what hubs is & what you can do

Hubs lets you bring in content from around the web (or your own computers / phones) to make shared, 3D spaces that you can invite friends to. Maybe you want to host some friends to watch videos on YouTube, live streams on Twitch, look at photos from a past vacation. Or, maybe you're a part of a community or company made up of people living all around the world, and you need a digital way to get together in one shared space. Hubs provides rooms where you can connect with the people who matter to you, and create custom places together. 

Hubs runs in the browser, so you can access rooms from your phone, desktop or laptop computer, or from within a virtual reality headset. 

## Create a New Room

* Creating a new room is easy... head to hubs.mozilla.com and press the new room link.

Go to [hubs.mozilla.com](hubs.mozilla.com) to get started with creating rooms. Click the 'Create a Room' button on the Hubs homepage, which will make a new private room for you to invite people to. If you are signed in with a Hubs account, you will be able to select a custom scene for your room and give the room a custom name.

Hubs rooms are private to anyone who has the link to the room, so you can bring other people in by giving them the unique url to the space you've created. From inside the room, click the 'Share' button at the top of the screen and send them the short link or the code to your room.
