<!-- ## Create a New Room -->
In the following guide we will show you the basics of how to use Hubs - Let's get started!

## Enter a Room

You are now in your room's lobby. You can see what's going on in the room but you can't interact. Entering the room is a bit different depending on your device.

**On a computer?** Click "Enter Room" and follow the prompts to select a name/avatar and set up the mic.

**On a VR headset or mobile device?** Check out detailed instructions in [Hubs' documentation](./hubs-joining-room).

## Explore Hubs

### Look around

Try exploring your new space. On desktop use your **WASD** keys to move around or use your right mouse button to jump. Rotate your view using the **Q** and **E** keys or hold down your left mouse button and drag.

### User Interface

Take a moment to take a look around the user interface. You can mute your mic, take photos, share your screen, create objects, and more. We'll introduce some of these controls in this guide. For more detailed information check out the [documentation](hubs-features).

### Create Objects

In Hubs you can import 3D models, images, videos and PDFs from almost anywhere on the web including SketchFab, Google Poly, SoundCloud, YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, Crunchyroll, and more. 

Try searching for media in the Media Browser (magic wand button at the top of the screen). 

You can also add media or by dragging and dropping a file into the room, or pasting a URL to the media (Ctrl+V or Command+V).

### Avatar Menus 

You can open up a menu on other users just like on objects. This lets you change their volume or hide them from view. If you are a room moderator, you will have extra permissions, like being able to mute someone's mic or temporarily kick them from the room.

### Change the Scene

Hubs' isn't limited to the default environment. There are lots of scenes to choose from, you can also upload your own using our scene editor [Spoke](./spoke-getting-started).

Only room moderators can change the scene. You'll need to sign up for an account to do this. All this takes is an email address for authentication. Signing in has other benefits, like saving favourite rooms, uploading custom avatars, but it is optional.  

Find the scene browser by going to the dropdown menu and selecting Choose a Scene.
