---

To create your own room, head to [hubs.mozilla.com](hubs.mozilla.com) and click “Create a Room.” 

## Receiving Invites
You can join an existing Hubs room using either a URL or a numeric code. Navigate to the URL in your browser or enter the code into [hubs.link](hubs.link).

## Lobby
Before entering the room, you are in the room's lobby. You can see what's going on in the room but you can only interact with the others in the room using text chat.

## Enter Room
This process is a bit different depending on your device.

### On Desktop / Mobile 

Click "Enter Room" and follow the prompts to select a username/avatar and set up the mic. On the final prompt select "Enter Room" or "Enter on Phone" if on mobile. 

### On a Standalone VR

If you opened the URL on your desktop or smartphone, choose "Enter on Standalone VR" to create a code that makes it easy to open on your standalone headset (e.g. Oculus Quest, Oculus Go, Samsung Gear).

Open the browser in your VR headset, navigate to [hubs.link](hubs.link) and enter the code. 

### On a Wired-in VR Headset

We recommend [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for wired-in headsets (e.g. Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Vive). To use desktop VR device with your headset, the Oculus app (Oculus Rift) or SteamVR (Windows Mixed Reality, Vive) must also be open.

On your computer, click "Enter Room" and follow the prompts to select a username/avatar and set up the mic. On the final prompt before entering you should see an option to select "Connected VR Headset."

For troubleshooting information visit the Hubs [troubleshooting](./hubs-faq) page.
