## Change Scenes

There are lots of scenes to choose from in our Featured Scenes list and Scenes Database. You can also upload your own using our scene editor [Spoke](./spoke-getting-started). Find the scene browser by opening the dropdown menu and selecting Choose a Scene. Note that feature scenes have been tested for performance across devices. 

For more information on how these are selected, take a look at our [content curation guidelines](./creators-content-guidelines.md). Room moderators only.

## Change Room Name

You can change the name of a room. To change it select 'Room Settings' from the dropdown menu and create a new name.Room moderators only.

## Favorite Rooms

Add a room to your list of favorites by clicking the star icon in the lower corner of the screen. This lets you easily find it when you come back to Hubs.

## Object Permissions

You can specify whether users in the room are able to create and move objects, pin content, and draw with the pen. By default these features are enabled. To toggle them select 'Room Settings' from the dropdown menu and toggle the permissions you want to set. 

## Promoting Room Moderators

When in a room with other trusted users, the room owner can promote other users to also have moderation permissions. Promoted moderators will have all of the same permissions as a room owner. It is important to ensure that users who are promoted to moderator are trusted parties, as they will have additional abilities to rename, change scenes, and close the room. To promote other users to moderators, select the user from the user list and click the 'Promote' button. Users need to be signed in to be promoted to moderators.

## Maximum Capacity

Hubs rooms have a maximum capacity of 25 people in-room to ensure performance across devices. Significantly more than this can watch from the lobby even when the room is full. Users in the lobby can hear what is going on inside the room, and can interact through chat with the people in the space.

## Camera Mode

To ensure that users are able to see exactly what they are meant to inside of the scene, the room moderator can turn on "Camera Mode" from the dropdown menu. This broadcasts their point of view to the people watching in the lobby, so they don't miss a thing! 

Camera mode also allows you to hide the user interface, which can be helpful when screencapturing.

## Kick Users

To temporarily kick a user from the room, open the avatar menu and select "kick." 

## Discord Authentication 

When you create a room in Hubs, it is private by default. Sharing the link or access code with other people allows them to enter that specific room, so generally, you want to be aware of who has the link.  

You can link a Hubs room to a channel in a Discord server and have your server members join with their Discord accounts. Banning a user from your server or removing them from the channel will prevent them from being able to re-join the linked Hubs room, even if that user still has the link to the room. You can learn more about the Hubs Discord bot [here](/hubs-discord-bot). 

## Close a Room

When you are finished with a Hubs room, you can choose to close the room by opening up the menu icon and selecting 'Close Room'. When you close a Hubs room, links and codes to the room will no longer work for anyone, including the room owner.
