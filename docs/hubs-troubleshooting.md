## Getting stuck on loading screen 

Rooms may have complex 3d models or objects in them which can increase the load time, particularly on less powerful devices (i.e. mobile phones and standalone VR headsets). If you are getting stuck on the loading screen, try refreshing the page or loading the scene on another browser or device. 

## Wired-in headset is not working

If your wired-in headset isn't connecting, we recommend checking the following:

* Does your browser supports WebVR? We recommend Firefox for wired-in WebVR experiences. To check, visit https://webvr.info/samples/XX-vr-controllers.html 
* Is your browser is up to date?
* Do you have SteamVR (Vive / Windows Mixed Reality) or Oculus App (Rift) installed and up to date?
* Does your VR headset require other supporting software (e.g. Windows Mixed Reality Portal)? Is this installed and up to date?
* Is your browser using the same graphics card as the VR Headset?

## There is echo in the room

Echo may occur if a participant is not wearing headphones. You can ask participants to mute their mic when they are not speaking, or as a room moderator you can mute them yourself in their avatar menu. You can also reduce the volume of the user in their avatar menu. See [Hubs Features](./hubs-features) for more information. 

## Images aren't displaying 

Some older systems have trouble rendering 2D objects in the scene. If you suspect this is happening, try reloading the page with the following flag at the end of the URL: __?disablebatching__

    e.g. https://hubs.mozilla.com/sgKNM3h/smart-magnificent-gala?disablebatching
