## Changing Name and Avatar

The first time you enter a Hubs room you will choose a name and avatar. You can change them at any time by clicking the dropdown menu in the top left-hand corner and selecting 'Set Name and Avatar'. 

Use one of our featured avatars or [upload your own](intro-avatars).

### My Avatars

For quick access to your favorite avatars, you can save them to "My Avatars" for quick access. Press the 'Copy to my Avatars' from the avatar selection screen.
