## Name and Avatar

The first time you enter a Hubs room you will choose a name and avatar. You can change them at any time by clicking the dropdown menu in the top left-hand corner and selecting "Set Name and Avatar." 

Use one of our featured avatars or [upload your own](customizing-avatars)

## User Accounts

You don't need an account to use Hubs, but some features are only available if you sign in. These include:

* Changing scenes
* Pinning objects in a room
* Using room moderation tools
* Saving rooms to favorites
* Adding avatars to "My Avatars"
* Uploading custom avatars

To set up an account, the only information we require is an email address.

## Favorite rooms

If you plan on returning to a room, make it easier to find by adding it to your favorites. Clicking the star in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. The room will now be accessible on the landing page, and in your list of favorite rooms.

To remove the room from your favorites, open the room and click the star icon again. 

## My Avatars

Avatars in the Featured and Newest lists can be saved to "My Avatars" for quick access. To make a copy, select the "Copy to my Avatars" button.
