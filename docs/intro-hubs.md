üéâ _Congratulations - you now have your very own VR space!_ 

Your new space is private; no one else can join until you invite them.

## Enter a Room

Before entering, you are in the room's lobby. You can see what's going on inside the room but you can't interact. Entering the room can be a bit different depending on the type of device you are using.

**On a desktop computer?** 

* Click "Enter Room" and follow the prompts to select a name/avatar and enable the mic

**On a VR headset or mobile device?** 

* Take a look at the [instructions](./hubs-create-join-rooms.html#enter-the-room) in Hubs' documentation

## Explore Hubs

### Look around

Try exploring your new space. On desktop use your **WASD** keys to move around, or use your right mouse button to jump. Rotate your view using the **Q** and **E** keys, or hold down your left mouse button and drag. 

For VR and mobile controls see our list of [Hubs controls](./hubs-controls).

### User Interface

Take a moment to take a look around the user interface. You can mute your mic, take photos, share your screen, create objects, and more. We'll introduce some of these controls in this guide. For more detailed information check out [Hubs Features](hubs-features) in the documentation.

### Import Media

In Hubs you can import 3D models, images, videos and PDFs from almost anywhere on the web including SketchFab, Google Poly, SoundCloud, YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, Crunchyroll, and more. 

Try searching for media in the Media Browser (the magic wand button at the top of the screen).

### Object Menus

Additional controls for objects, videos, and drawings can be found in the object menu.

To reveal these controls, hover your cursor over the object and press the space bar or tab key on Desktop.

### Avatar Menus 

You can open up a menu on users just like on objects. This lets you control their volume or hide them from your view. 

If you are a room moderator you will have extra permissions, like being able to mute the user's mic or temporarily kick them from the room.

### Change the Scene

Hubs' isn't limited to the default environment, there are lots of scenes to choose from. You can also create your own custom worlds using our scene editor [Spoke](./intro-spoke). Open the scene browser by opening the dropdown menu and selecting Choose a Scene.

Note, only room moderators can change the scene, and you will need to be logged in to Hubs. To sign up, all you need is an email address for authentication. Signing up is optional, but comes with other benefits such as being able to save favorite rooms, and upload custom avatars.
