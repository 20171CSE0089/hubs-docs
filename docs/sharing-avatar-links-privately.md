**Do you have a hubs room where you want specific avatars to be available for specific people but not others?**

**For example: an event where the performer has an exclusive avatar or moderators wear a custom moderator shirt, unavailable to attendees** Read on.

If you [create a custom avatar](./intro-avatars.md), you can create a new avatar, and then send it the .glb or the 2D avatar skin to the event organizers to upload it.

If you want to make it easier on the event organizers, you can create a "dressing room" for special avatars. This is a room, where the different options are on display for people to put on.

### Create a dressing room Instructions

1. Create a new Hubs room to be the "dressing room"
2. Upload the special avatar you want to share, and then find it in your list of "my avatars"
3. Right click on it and select "copy link location"

4. go back to the room, and then press CTRL+V (or CMD+V on mac), and a 2D representation of the avatar will appear
5. Pin this so it doesnt disappear when you leave (point cursor at it, press the space bar, there should be a pin option at the top)
6. Share the URL to this dressing room with the organizing team, to select an avatar, users just have to point at the one they want and select "use avatar"

Here's a screencapture of an example "dressing room"
