## What is it for
the architecture kit is used 
We first talked about the components of the Architecture Kit back in March. With the Architecture Kit, creators now have an additional way to build custom content for their 3D scenes without using an external tool. Specifically, we wanted to make it easier to take existing components that have already been optimized for VR and make it easy to configure those pieces to create original models and scenes. The Architecture Kit contains over 400 different pieces that are designed to be used together to create buildings - the kit includes wall, floor, ceiling, and roof pieces, as well as windows, trim, stairs, and doors. 

We wanted the Architecture Kit to be configurable beyond just the meshes. Buildings exist in a variety of contexts, so different pieces of the Kit can have one or more material slots with unique textures and materials that can be applied. This allows you to customize a wall with a window trim to have, for example, a brick wall and a wood trim. You can choose from the built-in textures of the Architecture Kit pieces directly in Spoke, or download the entire kit from GitHub.
