title: Spoke Creating Projects
---

Go to hubs.mozilla.com/spoke in your web browser. If this is your first time that you’ve used Spoke, you will have the option to follow a tutorial to get you familiar with the features. You can go through the tutorial to get a sense of the basics, or skip it if you are relatively comfortable with 3D editing controls.
From Templates

When you click ‘Get Started’ from the Spoke landing page, you will be taken to a project page. If you are signed in, your projects will be saved here so you can access them later. This page also has several project templates that you can start from and gives you a base environment to add content to.

With the Default Scene

If you create a new project from the 'New Project' button, you will be given a fresh environment to work from that includes the default content for Spoke scenes. From here, you can add and remove elements to make your own space, entirely to your liking!
From a .spoke file

You can also import existing Spoke files to use as a basis for your Spoke environment.

    Click the ‘New Project’ button
    In the menu, select File > Import legacy .spoke project
    Select ‘Ok’ in the prompt (be careful of overwriting something you want to keep) and then select the desired file to upload.
