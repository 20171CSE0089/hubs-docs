# Creating projects
## Create a new project

Go to hubs.mozilla.com/spoke in your web browser. If this is your first time that you’ve used Spoke, you will have the option to follow a tutorial to get you familiar with the features. You can go through the tutorial to get a sense of the basics, or skip it if you are relatively comfortable with 3D editing controls.
From Templates

When you click ‘Get Started’ from the Spoke landing page, you will be taken to a project page. If you are signed in, your projects will be saved here so you can access them later. This page also has several project templates that you can start from and gives you a base environment to add content to.

With the Default Scene

If you create a new project from the 'New Project' button, you will be given a fresh environment to work from that includes the default content for Spoke scenes. From here, you can add and remove elements to make your own space, entirely to your liking!

##  Import a Spoke project
From a .spoke file

You can also import existing Spoke files to use as a basis for your Spoke environment.

    Click the ‘New Project’ button
    In the menu, select File > Import legacy .spoke project
    Select ‘Ok’ in the prompt (be careful of overwriting something you want to keep) and then select the desired file to upload.

## Save Project

## Publishing Project

### Remixing types
When you publish your scene, you can choose to make your scene remixable, which means that others can build on what you’ve created from their own copies of your scene, and promotable, which will surface the scene through the ‘Scenes’ tab in the Hubs media browser. It is entirely up to you if you want to share your work in either of these ways!

### Allow mozilla to promote them


## Publish to Hubs

Always remember to generate a floor plan before exporting your scene to Hubs! This is the part of the scene that defines where avatars are able to walk or teleport to in your scene. If your scene is missing a floor plan element, add one from Elements > Floorplan. Then, select your floor plan in the Hierarchy and click ‘regenerate’. You can see which parts of the scene are walkable because they will have a blue highlight. Yellow wireframes represent the items that have a collision on them.

A classroom in outer space has a blue layer over the floor to indictae what is walkable.

You can publish a scene directly for use in Hubs, or you can export it as a legacy scene or .glb file. Please note that the following considerations apply:

    Exporting as a legacy Spoke scene will create a .spoke file that can be imported into another Spoke account. This functionality will be augmented by remixing soon, where you will be able to quickly remix a creative commons scene that other users have made.

    Exporting as a .glb (glTF binary) file will export the scene into a single .glb file that could be used in other programs that support loading glb files. Please note that the glb is a compiled binary, and cannot be opened in a readable-text format the way that glTF files can.

When you publish to Hubs, your scene will get a URL that uses the content within your Spoke environment. From this page, you can select ‘Create a Room with this Scene’ and make a new Hubs room that uses the scene as a base.

A dialog box shows a screenshot of the Spoke environment with a box to name the scene and add attributions before clicking a button that says 'Save and publish'

If you’ve added models from the search panel in Spoke, attributions for the content will be added to the scene description automatically, but you can add additional attributions for content that you’ve brought in from external sources.
