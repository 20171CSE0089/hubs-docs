Welcome to the Spoke wiki!

Spoke is an online 3D scene editor developed by the Mozilla Mixed Reality team. With Spoke, you can compose assets, lights, images, videos, and more to create an environment that can be used in Hubs rooms or exported as a glTF 3D model file.

 Discover: Explore images, videos, and 3D models from around the web, all without opening up a new tab. With media integrations from Sketchfab and Google Poly, you'll be on your way to creating a scene in no time.

‚úèÔ∏è Create: No external software or 3D modeling experience required - build 3D scenes using the Spoke web editor so you can have a space that's entirely custom to your needs. From a board room to outer space and beyond, your space is in your control.

üéâ Share: Invite people to meet in your new space by publishing your content to Hubs immediately. With just a few clicks, you'll have a world of your own to experience and share - all from your browser.
