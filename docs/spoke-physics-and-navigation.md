## floor plan


This is the part of the scene that defines where avatars are able to walk or teleport to in your scene. If your scene is missing a floor plan element, add one from Elements > Floorplan. Then, select your floor plan in the Hierarchy and click ‘regenerate’. You can see which parts of the scene are walkable because they will have a blue highlight. Yellow wireframes represent the items that have a collision on them.

A classroom in outer space has a blue layer over the floor to indicate what is walkable.
