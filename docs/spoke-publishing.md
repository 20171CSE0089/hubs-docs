title: Publishing your Scene
---

Always remember to generate a floor plan before exporting your scene to Hubs! This is the part of the scene that defines where avatars are able to walk or teleport to in your scene. If your scene is missing a floor plan element, add one from Elements > Floorplan. Then, select your floor plan in the Hierarchy and click ‘regenerate’. You can see which parts of the scene are walkable because they will have a blue highlight. Yellow wireframes represent the items that have a collision on them.

A classroom in outer space has a blue layer over the floor to indictae what is walkable.

You can publish a scene directly for use in Hubs, or you can export it as a legacy scene or .glb file. Please note that the following considerations apply:

    Exporting as a legacy Spoke scene will create a .spoke file that can be imported into another Spoke account. This functionality will be augmented by remixing soon, where you will be able to quickly remix a creative commons scene that other users have made.

    Exporting as a .glb (glTF binary) file will export the scene into a single .glb file that could be used in other programs that support loading glb files. Please note that the glb is a compiled binary, and cannot be opened in a readable-text format the way that glTF files can.

When you publish to Hubs, your scene will get a URL that uses the content within your Spoke environment. From this page, you can select ‘Create a Room with this Scene’ and make a new Hubs room that uses the scene as a base.

A dialog box shows a screenshot of the Spoke environment with a box to name the scene and add attributions before clicking a button that says 'Save and publish'

When you publish your scene, you can choose to make your scene remixable, which means that others can build on what you’ve created from their own copies of your scene, and promotable, which will surface the scene through the ‘Scenes’ tab in the Hubs media browser. It is entirely up to you if you want to share your work in either of these ways!

If you’ve added models from the search panel in Spoke, attributions for the content will be added to the scene description automatically, but you can add additional attributions for content that you’ve brought in from external sources.
