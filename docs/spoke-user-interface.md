Toggle Transform Space [Z]
regarding the transform space-- It's changing the transform gizmo to be oriented to the World XYZ vs. the Object's XYZ. You won't really see a difference until you rotate the object.
like, rotate a car 45 degrees. Then, to go 'forward', you'd want to switch to the object's local axis

## Properties Panel

Additional object properties can be set in the properties panel. This includes things like shadows, light color, and more.

Objects are added to Spoke and can be customized by changing their properties. Different types of objects have different properties available to them (for example, a light will have an ‘intensity’ property, but a 3D model won’t). Most objects will have transform properties, which represent the physical position in the space. You can modify the position, rotation, and scale of items by using the ‘Properties’ panel in the bottom right corner of the screen, or by using the handles in the viewport. You can change which control is applied to an object selected in the scene with the buttons in the top left corner of the display.



## assets panel

Your main path to adding content to a scene is through the Assets panel. Using the Assets panel, you can add content from your local computer, by searching the media browser, or linking to urls of files on the web. The Elements tab allows you to create objects without specifying properties. You can also create objects that contain specific properties by using the ‘Models’, ‘Videos’ or ‘Images’ tab to search. The ‘My Assets’ tab stores models, images, or videos that you have uploaded to your account from your local machine.

The assets panel, open in the Spoke editor, to show objects that can be added to the scene

The assets panel can be expanded and collapsed to make more room in the viewport as you work. In the top bar of the assets panel, you can select between different asset types in the drop down menu, and add specific filters to narrow down searches.
