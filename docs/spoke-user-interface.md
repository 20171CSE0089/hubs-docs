like, rotate a car 45 degrees. Then, to go 'forward', you'd want to switch to the object's local axis

__Transform Pivot [X]:__ Sometimes placing an object can be tough if the model's pivot point is set incorrectly. You can change how the pivot is caluclated using this dropdown menu. Can be set to center, bottom, or selection. 

__Toggle Snap mode [C]:__  Sometimes you may want to move and object with a prevision position or rotation. To do this toggle the snapping mode by clicking on the magnet icon. You can set the translation and rotation snap settings by using the dropdown menus.

## Viewport
![Hubs Image](img/spoke-user-interface.png)

The viewport shows a preview of what your scene will look like. Note that whatever the viewport is looking at when you upload it to hubs will be the scene's thumbnail image. 


## Hierarchy Panel
![Hubs Image](img/spoke-user-interface.png)
Objects you add to the scene show up in the hierarchy panel. Double click the object to add focus to it. you can also press the f key to focus the selected object

## Properties Panel
![Hubs Image](img/spoke-user-interface.png)

Additional object properties can be set in the properties panel. This includes things like shadows, light color, and more.

Objects are added to Spoke and can be customized by changing their properties. Different types of objects have different properties available to them (for example, a light will have an ‘intensity’ property, but a 3D model won’t). Most objects will have transform properties, which represent the physical position in the space. You can modify the position, rotation, and scale of items by using the ‘Properties’ panel in the bottom right corner of the screen, or by using the handles in the viewport. You can change which control is applied to an object selected in the scene with the buttons in the top left corner of the display.



## Assets Panel
![Hubs Image](img/spoke-user-interface.png)

Your main path to adding content to a scene is through the Assets panel. Using the Assets panel, you can add content from your local computer, by searching the media browser, or linking to urls of files on the web. The Elements tab allows you to create objects without specifying properties. You can also create objects that contain specific properties by using the ‘Models’, ‘Videos’ or ‘Images’ tab to search. The ‘My Assets’ tab stores models, images, or videos that you have uploaded to your account from your local machine.

## Experimental Features

We're continuously working on new features for Spoke. To try them out, you can enable experimental features. Note that these features are still in testing stages, and may not continue to be supported.

    In the menu, select Developer > Enable Experimental Features





The assets panel, open in the Spoke editor, to show objects that can be added to the scene

The assets panel can be expanded and collapsed to make more room in the viewport as you work. In the top bar of the assets panel, you can select between different asset types in the drop down menu, and add specific filters to narrow down searches.
