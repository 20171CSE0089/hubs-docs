In placement mode, objects can be placed on top of other objects or the grid . When building vertically it can be useful to change the grid height 
== increase grid height
-= decrease grid height



Toggle Transform Space [Z]
regarding the transform space-- It's changing the transform gizmo to be oriented to the World XYZ vs. the Object's XYZ. You won't really see a difference until you rotate the object.
like, rotate a car 45 degrees. Then, to go 'forward', you'd want to switch to the object's local axis
