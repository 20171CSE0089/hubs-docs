In Hubs you can choose how you want to represent yourself. Choose from any one of the featured or newest avatars, or create your own. 

Depending on how involved you'd like to get in the avatar creation process, you might choose to simply 're-skin' the existing robot or minecraft avatar by painting your own texture maps, or create your own fully custom 3D model.
