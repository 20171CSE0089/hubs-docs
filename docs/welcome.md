Hubs is a social VR platform that runs right in your browser. With Hubs you can create your own virtual space with a single click and invite others to join using a URL. No installation process or app store required. 

Watch videos with friends, give presentations, or meet with colleagues remotely. Hubs makes it easy to connect with others and share images, videos, 3D models, and more. 

Hubs works across platforms. Got a VR headset? Awesome! If not, you can use your desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or mobile device.

Hubs is open source and customizable. You can choose how you represent yourself by [uploading your own avatar](intro-avatars.html), and build your own world using Hubs' environment editor [Spoke](intro-spoke.html).

### Who is Hubs for?

Hubs is for anyone who wants to connect with others remotely! It's a great way to bring communities together in a virtual space. Host a conference, teach a class, create art, or just hang out with friends. Because of Hubs' spatialized audio you can have conversations with everyone together or break out into smaller groups, just like you can in person.
